1. User Sign Up

If you go to the website and you do not have an account, you can register
in seconds. All you need to register is an EMAIL ADDRESS, and a PASSWORD.

Immediately after sign-up, the user will be taken to their profile page
where he/she can manage their account profile.

2. E-Mail Address Verification

When a user signs up, an e-mail verification will be sent to the new user.
This verification is NOT required for the user to login, but IS required
for the user to subscribe to nofications and such.
