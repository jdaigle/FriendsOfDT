#	Due to bone-headedness on the part of the administrator (me), the 'people' table was erased this morning (September 13).<br>
#	Any people added between 7/12 and 9/12 will be listed as 'Deleted Person' until fixed (<b>currently $num_del</b>).<br>
#	Those people whose personal records were edited during that time have been reverted back to their July 12 state.<br>
#	If you signed up for the DB in the affected span, please re-register.  Sorry!<br><br>
