2007-07-28 Chris Luu wrote a v. cool six degrees feature.  Need to integrate.
2007-07-31 Re-worked the app so it is a series of included files.  Now it loads much faster.
2007-08-01 Changed the interface bar to include links to "What's new" and "6 Degrees".
2007-08-03 Chris Luu modified 6degrees to be a subset of index instead of a separate function.
	   He also made it so you could do cast or crew degrees.  Awesome!
2007-08-07 Added a page for stats.  Created top ten cast/crew lists.
2007-08-08 Added rearrange_title function.  Makes titles ending in ", The", ", A", or ", An" display nicely.
	   Everywhere except in the search buttons.  It's not worth it to fix there.
	   Added a note to the show edit page explaining proper article convention.
2007-08-15 Changed the search page so you can click the picture.  Also, removed the form.
	   Added CSS to pretty up the links on the search page.
	   Made the passwords into MD5 hashes.  Changed in DB and in session storage.
	   Expanded the password field to 32 characters and then did that again.  Good catch, Chris!
2007-08-18 Changed the search page so the whole table cell highlights on hover.
	   CSS is awesome.  Just puttin' that out there.
2007-08-22 Changed the stats page for crew to limit list to distinct shows.
	   This changed the people in the top ten (Sorry, Jimmy!).
2007-08-27 Added alt text for images on personal and show pages.  This should help GIS.
	   Also removed links and alt-text for default "no picture" images.
	   Added URL field for Crew positions.
	   Changed castcrew and show_detail routines to reflect the links if present.
2007-09-11 Added a routine to clean up empty entries in the DB.
	   Edited the delete routine to not print a big old message for each row deleted.
2007-09-13 Disaster!  Totally boned the database.  Replaced with old backup copy, created backup routine.
	   Horse stolen, the barn door is now locked.
2007-09-30 Added a "Browse the EC" page to the stats page.  Not the right place for it, but I was using it to help
	   restore some of the Deleted People.  Must remember to make it prettier, too.
2007-10-05 Added a "Most Awards" section to the stats page.
2007-10-08 Prettied up that EC browse page, as promised.
	   Moved "Browse Shows" to the stats page, replaced browse link in the interface with a stats link.
		Not sure I like it better.
2007-10-09 Modified delete routine to update the last_mod column in the _bkup table to show the date the 
	   deletion occurred.
2007-10-10 Got contacted by a theatre group in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.  They want to use IMDT.  
	   I'm pretty stoked about this.
2007-10-15 Created a function to delete people and shows.  Super-user only, disallows if there are 
	   existing associations to cast/crew/shows/awards/etc.  Created associated button on detail view.
2008-04-29 Chris Luu created a basic awards_by_year" function.  I prettied it up some.
	   Added a link to it from the Stats page as well.
2008-05-03 Modified the year column in the awards listings in peep_detail and show_detail to link to all 
	   awards for that year.
2008-06-17 Ran some w3 validators against the pages and found many issues, mostly with placement of close 
	   tags and links that use '&' instead of '&amp;'.  Corrected these in just about every file.  
	   Apparently, '_blank' is the new '_new'.  Who _knew?  I hope this will help with cellphone browsers.  
	   Every page is now Tidy.
2008-06-25 Fixed some alignment issues with how awards are displayed.  Cast and show pages are now consistent.
2008-07-15 Replaced the old ECbrowse with a function that lets you see EC by year, similar to awards_by_year.
2009-02-10 Updated the code to PHP5 and mySQL5 perforce.  Thanks, drive failure!
2009-02-19 Wrote media page index.  Wrote detail page Mark-1. Currently only support JPEGs.
2009-02-20 Refined media detail page to allow tying people and shows to images. Still feels kludgey.
2009-02-25 Changing naming scheme &c. for pictures to allow multiple pics, true media diversity.  Sinking into
	   a morass of tiny changes.  Losing hope.
2009-02-26 Added get_pic.php, full of tasty media tidbits.  Updated the DB to reflect new layer of abstraction 
	   for media.  Updated search, peep_detail, show_detail to use the new picture fetching routines.
2009-02-27 Replaced all calls to index images to use get_tinypic, which pulls from media table.
2009-02-28 Replaced editpeople headshot upload with choosing a default pic from uploaded media.  One step closer!
2009-03-01 Created media_default, a landing page for media_index that shows random pics.  I like it. Worked on upload routine.
2009-03-03 Redid the database, split media table into media and media_items.  this both simplifies and complicates 
2009-03-10 Media page is working.  Backing away slowly...
2009-03-25 Changed the thumbnail link of headshots and posters in detail pages to point to the associated media page.
	   Eliminated one SQL call in the process.
2009-03-29 Added style and code to make index pix on the default pic choice page pop up the thumbnail image.
2009-07-14 Fixed the bkup tables so delete routine would work again.
2009-12-28 Added "toaster" column in shows database, made necessary changes to show_detail and editshows routines to
	   incorporate a Toaster Location field.  Created "Toaster Hunt" page, listing all toaster appearances.
	   Also fixed the _bkup table so show deletes will work.  Thanks, past me, for keeping good notes!
2010-01-04 Added "FAIL" button to user approval page to more efficiently handle the crappy spammers.
2010-01-07 Linked the toaster in the logo to the toaster page.  just for fun.
2010-05-04 Created editsplash function.  One step closer to a brandable site.  May the 4th be with you. :)
2010-05-05 Made the durn thing actually work.  N.B.: Variables don't like to be escaped.  Happy Cinco de Whatever.
2010-07-07 Fixed minor formatting issues on the show page.
2010-09-25 Added reCaptcha to the registration page.  SPAM requests instantly dropped to zero!  Thanks, Google!
2011-02-01 SPAM requests are back on the rise - I don't get it!
2011-03-09 Added Facebook "like" button to the site.  Going to add them for individuals and shows once I get time.
